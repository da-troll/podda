# Changelog

All user-facing changes to Podda. The most recent entry is shown to users
in the "What's New" sheet on first launch after an update.

Format: one `## v<major>.<minor>.<patch> — <YYYY-MM-DD>` header per release,
followed by bullet points. `publish-update.sh` requires an entry matching
the version being published — releases without an entry fail.

## v1.1.0 — 2026-05-04

- Smaller download size and improved crash diagnostics under the hood
